# jamftools

These are a random set of scripts and tools for the Jamf environments, many of which rely on Mark Stratman's CocoaDialog 3 or other utilities where specified.

At some point this readme will be more indepth. I also may owe Will Green, Isaac Ordonez, and Matthew Bodaly a drink or three for my bash and jamf know-how, so blame them for everything I've done wrong here. 

Have fun.
