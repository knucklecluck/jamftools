# jamftools

These are a random set of scripts and tools for Jamf environments, some of which rely on Mark Stratman's CocoaDialog or other utilities where specified.

At some point this readme will be more in-depth. I also may owe Will Green, Isaac Ordonez, and Matthew Bodaly a drink or three for my bash and Jamf know-how, so blame them for everything I've done wrong here. 

Have fun.
